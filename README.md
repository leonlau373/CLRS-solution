Here is some implementation for CLRS 3rd Edition.

I might be slow admittedly, but I'll try to implement most of the algorithm here!

Note: This is not intended to be a collection of solutions in CLRS, in fact, some problems / exercises implementation might be "hiding" in the main implementation, since it's easier to keep track of those that way, instead of making a new file for each exercise.
